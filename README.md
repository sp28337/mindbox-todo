# Mindbox Todo — Test Assignment

This repository contains one of my first **test assignments**, implemented as a simple **Todo application** using **React** and **TypeScript**.  
The project was created to demonstrate basic frontend skills and understanding of React fundamentals.

During development, I worked with **functional components, state management, user interactions, and basic application logic**. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and includes basic setup for testing using React Testing Library.

This repository reflects my early hands-on experience with React and frontend development and was an important step in building confidence with real-world coding tasks and technical assignments.
